Founded by Roover and Shell in 2021, Omega has transformed from a group of novice programmers to a professional brand of capable minds.

# ‚ùì What do we do? ‚ùì
Omega started off as a team of two python coders, Roover and Shell, who coded tools for Discord.com. Our organization has expanded our knowledge, which now covers several languages (Rust, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript) and several topics. 

We have big plans for future projects, which will be better than anything we have produced in the past.

# üìì Notable projects: üìì
- Selfcord : With 55 stars on Github, Selfcord was our most advertised project. It was a Discord API wrapper available on PIP.
- Bolt-Scraper : A very well known Discord token scraper for Repl.it written in Rust. It was so powerful it made Repl change its own API.
- Pysint : Pysint was our early attempt at making a useful OSINT tool.

Also see affiliated projects from our members:
- Viperlang : A programming language developed by https://github.com/viper-org
- ViperOS : An operating system developed by https://github.com/viper-org
